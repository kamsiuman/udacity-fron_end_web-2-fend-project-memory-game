## Requirment

-- COngruations pop : it is done (with the moves# and the times ); also it will reset once the user close the modal dialog box.

-- restart button : it works (reset all the timer/ move count and CLEAR all the open and matched cards)

-- star rating ( I decrement by 1 after 16th and 24th moves)

-- timer : done

-- move-count : done..

## Comment

-- I tried to modualized as much as i could
-- I would like to learn what is the better way to moduleized the function. the most concerning is the ordering of the functions whic are also intermiggling with the varible and the DOM elements refernences. the code is not very maintainable which I am looking forward to the solution in the latter of this course.
